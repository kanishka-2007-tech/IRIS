## Problem Statement

Safety systems today are largely reactive, activating only after a crime or dangerous
situation has already begun. This approach significantly limits their effectiveness,
especially in preventing crimes related to women’s safety and vulnerable populations.

Most safety applications depend on panic buttons or manual alerts, which may not be usable
in high-stress situations. Additionally, current systems lack predictive intelligence and
do not consider contextual factors such as time, crowd density, or environmental conditions.

There is a strong need for an intelligent, proactive, and ethical safety solution that can
identify risks early and help individuals avoid dangerous situations before they occur.
