INTELLIGENT RISK IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM 
# AI-Based Smart Safety & Crime Prevention System
## 🔍 Problem Statement
Most existing safety solutions are reactive and respond only after an incident has begun.
With increasing crime rates, especially crimes affecting women and vulnerable individuals,
there is an urgent need for systems that can predict and prevent danger before it occurs.

Traditional safety applications rely heavily on manual panic buttons, which may not be
effective in high-stress or restricted-mobility situations.

## 💡 Solution
We propose an AI-based Smart Safety and Crime Prevention System that shifts safety from
reactive response to predictive prevention. The system analyzes historical crime data,
time-based risk patterns, crowd density, and urban infrastructure factors such as street
lighting to generate real-time risk insights.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Crime-related data is processed using machine learning models
2. Risk levels are predicted for locations based on time and conditions
3. Users receive proactive alerts before entering high-risk zones
4. Safe route recommendations guide users through low-risk paths
5. Voice-activated emergency alerts provide hands-free assistance
