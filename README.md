INTELLIGENT RISK IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM 
# AI-Based Smart Safety & Crime Prevention System
## 🔍 Problem Statement
Personal safety is now a daily concern rather than an exception due to the sharp rise in crimes like rape, sexual harassment, stalking, and theft. Working professionals, women, and students frequently avoid travelling alone, especially at night, because they feel unsafe rather than because they want to. Freedom, opportunities, and quality of life are all restricted by this ongoing fear.

Safety apps and emergency helplines are available, but most require users to press a button or send a message. In real emergencies, people might panic, freeze, or be unable to use their phones, so help can arrive too late. Current systems react after an incident instead of helping to prevent risky situations.

Another problem is that people often do not know which areas are unsafe or when risks are higher. They may walk through poorly lit or high-crime areas without any warning. Text alerts also do not show how distressed someone feels, so family members may not realize how serious the situation is.

This establishes a definite need for a safety solution that is preventive, fast, and easy to use without the need for physical engagement. There is a pressing need for a solution that can detect risk early, help users make safer decisions, and react immediately when a risk is detected without invading the users’ privacy.

## 💡 Solution
IRIS (Intelligent Risk Identification System) is a safety system meant to help when you're scared, panicking, or don't have time to do things manually. Most safety apps make you press buttons or send texts, but IRIS is better. You just use your voice to call for help without touching your phone.

IRIS figures out where there might be danger by checking public crime data, when crimes usually happen, how many people are around, and if things like streetlights are working. It uses this info to make a simple safety map that shows safe and risky areas at different times. This helps you decide the best way to go.

If things get bad, you just say a special voice command to start emergency mode. IRIS will automatically call emergency services nearby, share where you are, tell your emergency contacts, and record what's happening around you, along with any signs of you being distressed. This gives a clear view of what’s going on in real-time. Texting systems can’t do that.

IRIS spots risks early and lets you respond hands-free in emergencies, making safety a way to prevent problems, not just react to them. It's created with strong privacy and your permission, so it’s practical, moral, and can be used by lots of people. It aims to make you feel safer and more confident in your daily life.
